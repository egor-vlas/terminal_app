## **Develop** a statement of **purpose** and **scope** for your application. It must include:

### **describe** at a high level what the application will do:

The application will convert data from the Imperial metric system into the Metric system and from the Metric into the Imperial.  Users will see instructions on their computer screens and then follow them to convert data.

### **identify** the problem it will solve and **explain** why you are developing it

A lot of people get confused with converting Fahrenheits into Celsius or kilometers into miles, the application will make converting a little bit easier. The application will take the user's input with data in Imperial or Metric standard and will convert it into the opposite.

### **identify** the target audience

The target audience is people who need to convert data from one metric system to another.

 It could be used by very large audience. The main requirement is to have a laptop.

### **explain** how a member of the target audience will use it

Users will install it on their computer and then follow instructions on a screen.

### **Develop** a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:

### \- at least THREE **features**

### \- **describe** each feature

Users will be able to choose which metric system to use for concertation purposes. They will see welcome message informing them to press 1 for selecting metric system and press 2 for selecting Imperial measuring system. After users have chosen which measuring system they want to convert they can follow instructions and enter quantity they want to convert.

Users will be able to select: 

- Imperial measuring system.
- Metric measuring system.
- Converting from miles to kilometers
- Converting from kilometers into miles
- Converting from Celsius to Fahrenheits 
- Converting from Meters to Foots.
- Converting from Inches to Centimeters .
